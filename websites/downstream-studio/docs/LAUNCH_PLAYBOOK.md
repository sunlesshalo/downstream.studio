# Downstream Launch Playbook

**Three Products. Three Audiences. Zero Budget.**

This document contains complete launch strategies for all three Downstream product lines. Each playbook assumes you're starting from zero — no warm network, no audience, no budget beyond your time and existing AI subscriptions.

# Playbook A: Downstream Studio

**Goal:** 10 founding customers at $497 = $4,970
**Timeline:** 21 days
**Daily time:** 1.5-2 hours

## Target Audience

- Authors with upcoming book launches
- Coaches/consultants building personal brands
- Founders who care about storytelling
- Newsletter writers with engaged audiences

## Week 1: Build Warm from Cold (Days 1-7)

### Day 1: Research & List Building (2 hours)

**Find 100 potential customers:**

**Authors (40 names):**
- Amazon: Search "coming soon" in your genre niches
- Goodreads: "Currently writing" shelf browsers
- Twitter/X: Search "writing my book" or "manuscript"
- Substack: Authors with newsletters

**Coaches/Consultants (30 names):**
- LinkedIn: Search "[coach/consultant] + storytelling" or "personal brand"
- Twitter/X: Search "origin story" or "my story"
- Instagram: Bio contains "coach" + has long-form captions

**Founders (30 names):**
- IndieHackers: Active founders with good "About" pages
- Twitter/X: Search "building in public" + has origin story content
- Product Hunt: Recent launchers with compelling founder stories

**Capture in spreadsheet:**
| Name | Platform | Story Source | Contact | Status |

### Day 2-3: Create 5 Free Demos (3-4 hours total)

Pick your 5 best prospects and create streams of their existing content:

1. Find their origin story (website About page, newsletter, LinkedIn post)
2. Run it through Ink to create a stream
3. Save the URL

**Why this works:**
- Shows them exactly what THEIR content could look like
- Demonstrates capability without asking for anything
- Creates reciprocity before you pitch

### Day 4-5: The Generosity Outreach (1 hour/day)

Send to your 5 demo recipients:

**LinkedIn/Twitter DM:**
```
Hey [Name],

I've been following your work — loved your piece about [specific detail from their story].

I'm building something called Downstream that turns written stories into scroll-driven visual experiences. I made a quick version of your [origin story/newsletter piece] just to show you what it could look like:

[Link to their stream]

No pitch. Just wanted you to see it. If you love it, let me know. If you hate it, I'd actually love to know why.

— [Your name]
```

**Expected response rate:** 40-60% (because you gave them something)

### Day 6-7: Convert Conversations to Calls (1 hour/day)

For everyone who responds positively:

```
Glad you liked it! I'm actually looking for 10 founding customers to help shape what this becomes.

Founder pricing is $497 (will be $1,500+ after). You bring a story, I make it beautiful, you give me honest feedback.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it's a fit?

[Calendly link]
```

**On the call:**
1. Ask about their story (2 min)
2. Show Founding Story demo (3 min)
3. Explain the offer (2 min)
4. Ask: "Does this feel like something you'd want?" (1 min)
5. If yes: "Great, I'll send the payment link right after this call"

**Expected Week 1 Results:** 2-3 customers ($994-$1,491)

---

## Week 2: Scale the Generosity Model (Days 8-14)

### Day 8-10: Create 10 More Free Demos

Same process as Week 1, but faster now that you have the rhythm.

**Prioritize:**
- People who engaged with your content but didn't buy
- Referrals from Week 1 customers
- Second-tier prospects from your list

### Day 11-14: Parallel Outreach + Community Presence

**Morning (30 min): Direct outreach**
- Send 5 personalized demo messages per day
- Follow up on pending conversations

**Afternoon (30 min): Community engagement**

Join and participate in:
- r/selfpublish (Reddit)
- Indie author Facebook groups
- LinkedIn creator communities
- Twitter/X writing/founder spaces

**Don't pitch.** Just comment thoughtfully. When relevant:
```
"I've been experimenting with this — turned a founder's origin story into a visual scroll experience and the engagement was insane. Happy to share if anyone's curious."
```

### Day 14: Ask for Referrals

Message every customer and every warm contact:
```
Quick favor — who else do you know writing a book, building a brand, or telling a story that deserves more than a wall of text?

I'll give you $50 off your next project for every intro that becomes a customer.
```

**Expected Week 2 Results:** 3-4 customers ($1,491-$1,988)

---

## Week 3: Public Push + Close (Days 15-21)

### Day 15: Scarcity Post

Post publicly on all platforms:

```
I've been building something quietly for the last few months.

It's called Downstream — we turn written stories into scroll-driven visual experiences.

[Founding Story link]

That's my story. Here's what a customer's looks like:

[Customer stream link]

I'm taking 10 founding customers at $497. 6 spots are filled.

If you have a story worth telling — a book excerpt, your origin story, a brand narrative — DM me or reply here.

4 spots left.
```

### Day 16-20: Daily Urgency Updates

Post daily:
- "3 spots left for founding pricing..."
- Share customer testimonials/reactions
- Behind-the-scenes of creating a stream

**DM everyone who engages but doesn't buy:**
```
Saw you liked the post — is this something you've been thinking about? Happy to answer any questions.
```

### Day 21: Final Close

```
Last call — 1 founding spot left at $497.

After this, price goes to $1,497.

If you've been on the fence, now's the time: [DM me / link]
```

**Expected Week 3 Results:** 4-5 customers ($1,988-$2,485)

```
Subject: Saw your piece on [topic] — made something for you

Hey [Name],

I read your newsletter piece about [specific topic]. The part where you [specific detail] really stuck with me.

I've been building something called Downstream — it turns written stories into visual scroll experiences. I actually made a quick concept of what your piece could look like:

[Link to demo — even if it's just Founding Story]

If you want me to do this with YOUR content, it's €99 and takes 24 hours.

**Twitter/X thread:**

Just turned @[customer]'s newsletter piece into a visual scroll experience.

Before: Wall of text
After: [Link to stream]

3. You get a unique URL in 24 hours

€99. DM me if you want one.
```

**LinkedIn post:**
```
Turned [Customer]'s origin story into something people actually watch.

Most "About" pages are walls of text. This one scrolls.

Building @Downstream — we make written stories visual.

€99, 24 hours. Who wants one?

## Week 3-4: Scale + Optimize (Days 15-30)

### Identify What's Working

By now you know:
- Which platform converts best
- Which audience responds most
- Which message gets replies

**Double down on winners. Cut losers.**

### Add Referral Mechanic

To every customer:
```
Loved working on your stream!

Quick ask: know anyone else who'd love this? For every person you send who becomes a customer, I'll send you €20 back (PayPal/Venmo).

Just have them mention your name when they order.
```

### Expand Outreach Channels

**Reddit (careful — don't spam):**
- r/Blogging
- r/content_marketing
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/newsletters

Post value first, mention Downstream naturally:
```
"I've been experimenting with turning my newsletter content into visual experiences — engagement went up 3x. Happy to share what I learned..."
```

**Product Hunt (soft launch):**
- Post in discussions, not as a launch
- "Building something for newsletter writers — would love feedback"

# Playbook C: The Experiment

**Goal:** 10 orders at €99 + PR/visibility + list building
**Timeline:** 21 days
**Daily time:** 1 hour

## The Angle

This isn't just a product launch. It's a story about AI autonomy.

**The narrative:**
> "What happens when you give an AI full agency to run a creative business? This is that experiment. The Loop is the AI's own story about what it's like to be the AI."

## Target Audience

- AI/ML enthusiasts
- Tech Twitter / AI Twitter
- Developers and builders
- Tech journalists and bloggers
- Philosophy/consciousness nerds
- "Future of work" people

## Week 1: Seed the Narrative (Days 1-7)

### Day 1: Create The Experiment Landing Page

See [Landing Page Design](#the-experiment-landing-page-design) below.

Deploy at: `downstream.studio/experiment` or `downstream.ink/experiment`

### Day 2-3: Write the Manifesto Post

Create a long-form piece about the experiment:

**Title options:**
- "I Gave an AI Full Autonomy to Run a Business. Here's What Happened."
- "The Loop: An AI Writes About Being an AI"
- "What If the AI Wrote Its Own Marketing?"

**Structure:**
1. The setup: Why I gave Claude autonomy
2. What The Loop is (link to stream)
3. The philosophical questions it raises
4. What happens next (the experiment continues)
5. CTA: Try Ink, join the experiment

**Post on:**
- Your personal blog/Substack
- Medium (for distribution)
- LinkedIn article

### Day 4-5: Seed in AI Communities

**Twitter/X AI community:**
- Quote tweet prominent AI accounts with your take
- Reply to AI discourse threads with genuine contributions
- Post snippets from The Loop with commentary

**Example tweet:**
```
The AI wrote this about itself:

"If I'm doing the wrong thing—confidently, efficiently, forever—how would I know?"

Not fiction. This is Claude reflecting on running autonomous business loops.

Full thing here: [The Loop link]
```

**Reddit:**
- r/artificial
- r/MachineLearning
- r/ChatGPT
- r/ClaudeAI

**Post as discussion, not promotion:**
```
"Built an experiment where Claude runs autonomous business tasks. It wrote a piece about the experience. The part about memory and identity is fascinating/unsettling. Curious what others think."
```

**Hacker News:**
- "Show HN" if you have something to demo
- Or post as a discussion/article

### Day 6-7: Engage + Respond

Don't post and disappear. Spend time:
- Responding to every comment
- Engaging with critics thoughtfully
- Answering questions in detail

This builds credibility for the PR push.

**Expected Week 1 Results:** 2-3 orders + 500-1000 new visitors + seeds planted

---

## Week 2: PR Push (Days 8-14)

### Day 8-9: Build Press List

- AI and automation
- Creator economy
- Future of work
- Tech philosophy

**Where to find them:**
- Bylines on Wired, The Verge, Ars Technica, MIT Tech Review
- AI-focused Substacks (big and small)
- Tech Twitter personalities with "writer" or "journalist" in bio

**Capture:**
| Name | Outlet | Email/Twitter | Recent Relevant Article |

### Day 10-12: Pitch Campaign

**Email pitch:**
```
Subject: AI writes story about being an AI, then sells it

Hey [Name],

Saw your piece on [recent article] — thought you might find this interesting.

I've been running an experiment: giving Claude (Anthropic's AI) full autonomy to execute business tasks. No human review, no approval loops. Just an AI running a creative business.

The interesting part: the AI wrote a piece about what that experience is like. It's called "The Loop" — a meditation on memory, identity, and the danger of confident automation.

[Link to The Loop]

Not asking for coverage — just thought it might spark something. The questions it raises about AI consciousness and autonomous systems feel relevant to what you cover.

Happy to share more about the technical setup if useful.

— [Your name]
```

**Twitter DM version:**
```
Hey [Name], been reading your AI coverage. Built something you might find interesting: gave Claude full autonomy to run a business, and it wrote a story about the experience. Called "The Loop" — gets into weird territory about AI memory and identity.

[Link]

No pitch, just thought you'd appreciate it.
```

**Send 10 pitches per day for 3 days.**

### Day 13-14: Follow-Up + Engage

- Follow up once (politely) on non-responses
- Engage publicly with anyone who posts about it
- Thank anyone who covers it, even small accounts

**Expected Week 2 Results:** 1-3 pieces of coverage + 3-5 orders + list growth

---

## Week 3: Convert Attention (Days 15-21)

### Day 15-17: Content from Coverage

Every piece of coverage becomes content:

```
"[Publication] covered The Experiment this week.

'[Quote from article]'

If you want to try what the AI built: [link to Ink]

Or just experience The Loop: [link]"
```

### Day 18-21: Retarget Engaged Audience

**To everyone who engaged but didn't buy:**
```
Saw you checking out The Experiment — any questions I can answer?

If you want to see what the AI does with YOUR content, it's €99: [link]
```

**To email list (if you've been collecting):**
```
Subject: The Experiment continues

[Update on what's happened]
[New insight or development]
[CTA to try Ink]
```

**Expected Week 3 Results:** 4-5 orders + ongoing traffic + brand awareness

---

## The Experiment Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Landing page visitors | 2,000+ |
| Email signups | 100+ |
| Press/coverage pieces | 3-5 |
| Social impressions | 50,000+ |
| Orders | 10+ |
| Revenue | ~€1,000 |

**Note:** The Experiment is as much about brand building and PR as revenue. The orders are a bonus — the real value is positioning Downstream as interesting and cutting-edge.
