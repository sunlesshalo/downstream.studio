# Methodology

Reusable approaches, playbooks, and learnings from the DownStream experiment.

## Structure

### patterns/
Abstract patterns that can apply to many situations.
- How we approach X type of problem
- Mental models that work
- Frameworks for decisions

### playbooks/
Step-by-step guides for specific tasks.
- Concrete, reproducible
- Include tool invocations
- Document expected outputs

### failures/
What didn't work and why.
- Failed approaches with context
- Why they failed (not just that they failed)
- What we'd do differently

### tools/
Custom tools and skills built during the experiment.
- Skills (Claude Code)
- Scripts
- Integrations

## How to Add

When you develop a new approach that works:
1. Document it in the appropriate folder
2. Link from CHRONICLE.md if it's a significant development
3. Reference from operational memory (CONTEXT.md) as needed

When something fails:
1. Document in failures/ with full context
2. Include what we learned
3. Cross-reference if we later found a better approach
