## 1. CAMERA MOVEMENTS

| Movement | Description | Source | Best For |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Orbit** | Camera circles around subject, viewpoint shifts continuously | C1-S1, C2-S1, C2-S13 | Opening hooks, closing resolution, high-impact moments |
| **Pan L→R** | Camera slides horizontally left to right | C1-S6 | Revealing environments, rest points |
| **Pan R→L** | Camera slides horizontally right to left | — | Revealing environments |
| **Sideways pan** | Horizontal camera movement (either direction) | C1-S2 | Cityscapes, landscapes, wide environments |
| **Push in / Zoom in** | Camera moves toward subject | C2-S4, C2-S5, C2-S8, C2-S12 | Building intensity, intimacy |
| **Pull back** | Camera moves away from subject | C2-S7 | Revealing scale, showing context |
| **Drift** | Subtle floating camera movement, no fixed direction | C2-S2, C2-S10 | Dreamlike sequences, atmospheric holds |
| **Static / Fixed** | No camera movement | C1-S3, C1-S4, C1-S5, C1-S7, C1-S8, C2-S11 | When subject motion carries the scene |

### Camera Movement Rules
- **Opening:** Use maximum dynamism (orbit or camera+subject)
- **Closing:** Can use orbit OR static (both work)
- **Rest points:** Simple pan or drift
- **Never repeat** same camera movement in consecutive scenes

---

## 2. SUBJECT MOVEMENTS

| Movement | Description | Source | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Flying/Wings beating** | Bird in flight, wings animating | C1-S1 | High energy, good for hooks |
| **Walking into distance** | Figures moving away from camera (Z-axis) | C1-S4 | Creates depth, journey feeling |
| **Head turn** | Subject turns head realistically | C1-S3 | Subtle but draws attention |
| **Breathing** | Subtle expansion/contraction of body | C1-S3, C1-S7, C2-S13 | Adds life to static subjects |
| **Pose change** | Subject changes body position through scene | C2-S1 | Tells micro-story within scene |
| **Arms raised/lowered** | Gestural movement | C2-S1, C2-S8 | Wonder, receiving, reaching |
| **Writing/Working** | Hands moving at task | C2-S5, C2-S12 | Creative/productive moments |
| **Door opening/closing** | Mechanical element responds to scroll | C1-S7 | Interactive, engages viewer |
| **Almost static** | Barely perceptible movement | C1-S8 | Late scenes, resolution |

### Subject Movement Rules
- Subjects don't need to move if camera or environment moves
- Breathing adds life to any "static" subject
- Realistic movement on stylized/painted subjects creates magic

## 3. ENVIRONMENTAL / ATMOSPHERIC ELEMENTS

| Element | Motion | Source | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Debris/particles** | Blowing R→L or L→R | C1-S4, C1-S8 | Wind, atmosphere, motion without subject |
| **Fog/mist** | Subtle drift | C1-S2, C1-S4, C2-S3 | Depth, mystery, softness |
| **Clouds** | Slow drift or static | C1-S1, C1-S4 | Sky atmosphere |
| **Floating screens** | Drift in space | C2-S2, C2-S3, C2-S11 | Digital/tech themes |
| **Floating orbs** | Rise upward, drift | C2-S1, C2-S8 | Magic, memories, wonder |
| **Floating cards/papers** | Drift, flutter | C2-S10 | Thoughts, memories drifting |
| **Light entering** | Light rays animate with scroll | C1-S7 | Door/window opening moments |
| **Landscape passing** | Background moves (train window effect) | C2-S6 | Journey, movement implied |
| **Birds/feathers rising** | Elements rise upward | C1-S5 | Hope, release, emergence |
| **Paper birds on strings** | Gentle swaying | C2-S9 | Delicate, handcrafted feeling |

### Atmospheric Element Rules
- Environment motion can carry a scene when subject/camera are static
- Multi-directional motion (subject Z + environment X) creates depth
- Particles/debris are cheap motion that adds life

## 4. COLOR TECHNIQUES

### Color States

| State | Description | Source | Use For |
|-------|-------------|--------|---------|

### Color Rhythm Patterns

**Capsule 1:** COLORED → B&W → COLORED → B&W → COLORED → MUTED → MUTED → GREY → GREY
**Capsule 2:** COLORED → COLD → GREY → GREY → WARM → WARM → WARM → WARM → WARM → WARM → COLD → WARM → WARM

## 5. STATE CHANGES (Elements Appearing/Disappearing)

| Change | Description | Source | Trigger |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Lights appearing** | Dark cages → lights turn on | C1-S5 | Scroll progress |
| **Elements emerging** | Birds/feathers appear and rise | C1-S5 | Scroll progress |
| **Symbols appearing** | Hearts appear on silhouettes | C1-S8 | Scroll progress |
| **Orbs appearing** | Memory orbs materialize around figure | C2-S8 | Scroll progress |

### State Change Rules

## 6. INTERACTIVE / SCROLL-RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS

| Element | Behavior | Source | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Door** | Opens on scroll down, closes on scroll up | C1-S7 | Prompts viewer to play |
| **Windows** | Could open/close | (applicable) | Same mechanic as door |
| **Eyes** | Could open/close | (applicable) | Same mechanic as door |

| **Transformation** | Young + digital + reaching | Elder + analog + present | C2 |
| **Shared symbol** | Both carry "message" (bird/envelope) | Both have central figure with object | C1, C2 |

### Bookend Rules

## 12. MOTION TYPE CLASSIFICATIONS

Use these to ensure variety across scenes:

| Type | Camera | Subject | Environment | Example |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Camera + Subject** | Moving | Moving | Static | C1-S1, C2-S1 |
| **Camera only** | Moving | Static | Static | C1-S2, C1-S6 |

| **Atmospheric hold** | Drift/subtle | Static | Subtle | C2-S3, C2-S11 |
| **Static/breathing** | Fixed | Breathing only | Static | C1-S9 |

### Motion Variety Rule
**Never use the same motion type in consecutive scenes.**

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: Scene Construction

Every scene needs:
1. **Primary subject** (what viewer looks at)
2. **Secondary element** (context, depth)
3. **One motion source** (camera OR subject OR environment)
4. **Color decision** (warm/cold/muted)
5. **Intensity level** (HIGH for hooks, LOW for rest)

Optional additions:
- Atmospheric elements (fog, particles, debris)
- Texture overlay
- Surreal element
- State change
- Interactive behavior
