## PART 1: INTER-SCENE RELATIONSHIPS

### CAPSULE #1 - SCENE-BY-SCENE RELATIONAL ANALYSIS

---

#### SCENE 1 (0-1900px): THE BIRD

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Subject | Red cardinal bird |
| Subject Change | POSITION: enters bottom → rises through frame → exits top |
| Subject Scale | Constant (large, ~60% of visual) |
| Subject State | No color/form change |
| Motion Intensity | **HIGH** - continuous movement through entire scene |
| Background | Static clouds |

---

#### SCENE 2 (1900-3800px): THE CITY

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Subject | Berlin cityscape (Brandenburg Gate) |
| Subject Change | NONE - static hold |
| Motion Intensity | **LOW** - only fog drift |
| Relationship to Scene 1 | **CONTRAST** - from high motion to stillness |
| Palette Shift | Warm red → Cold grey |

**RHYTHM OBSERVATION:** Scene 1 = HIGH motion, Scene 2 = LOW motion. The experience BREATHES after the opening.

---

#### SCENE 3 (3800-5700px): THE CANARY

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Subject | Canary in cage |
| Subject Change | **COLOR**: Yellow → Red (at ~5200px) |
| Motion Intensity | **LOW** then **STATE CHANGE** |
| Relationship to Scene 2 | Similar low motion, but with PAYOFF (state change) |
| Palette | Warm amber |

**RHYTHM:** Still breathing (low), but with a PUNCTUATION (color shift).

---

#### SCENE 4 (5700-7900px): THE FIGURES

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Subject | Two tiny silhouettes |
| Subject Change | NONE - static |
| Subject Scale | **TINY** (<5% of frame) |
| Motion Intensity | **MINIMAL** - atmospheric only |
| Relationship to Scene 3 | Scale shift: large subject → tiny subjects |
| Composition | Negative space dominance |

**RHYTHM:** Most meditative scene. Placed at ~1/3 through story. The experience RESTS here.

---

#### SCENE 5 (7900-9300px): THE CAGES

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Subject | Multiple hanging cages |
| Subject Change | POSITION: parallax shift between layers |
| Element Count | 3+ elements at different depths |
| Motion Intensity | **MEDIUM** - parallax movement |
| Relationship to Scene 4 | Complexity increase after rest |

**RHYTHM:** After the meditative Scene 4, complexity and motion RETURN.

---

#### SCENE 6 (9300-12000px): THE WORKERS

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Subject | Two people at wall |
| Subject Change | Minimal - possible subtle zoom |
| Duration | LONGEST (2700px) |
| Motion Intensity | **LOW** |
| Relationship to Scene 5 | Slowing down again after parallax |

**RHYTHM:** Another breathing moment. Long hold.

---

#### SCENE 7 (12000-13000px): GLASS STRUCTURE

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Primary Subject | Figure in glass structure |
| Subject Change | NONE |

|-----------|-------|
| Primary Subject | Two silhouettes against city |
| Subject Change | NONE |
| Motion Intensity | **LOW** |
| Relationship to Scene 7 | Echoes Scene 4 (figures in fog) |

---

### THE MOTION INTENSITY GRAPH

```
Scene:  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
        ████ ▓▓   ▓▓█  ░░   ███  ▓▓   ▓▓   ▓▓   ░░
        HIGH LOW  LOW+ MIN  MED  LOW  LOW  LOW  MIN
              ↓         ↓        ↓              ↓
           BREATHE    REST   RETURN          RESOLVE
```

**Pattern:** HIGH → LOW → LOW → MINIMAL → MEDIUM → LOW → LOW → LOW → MINIMAL

---

### THE RHYTHM FORMULA

1. **Open HIGH** - grab attention with movement (Scene 1)
2. **Drop to LOW** - let viewer settle (Scene 2)
3. **LOW with PUNCTUATION** - state change as reward (Scene 3)
4. **MINIMAL (rest)** - deepest breathing moment at ~1/3 point (Scene 4)
5. **RETURN to MEDIUM** - complexity returns (Scene 5)
6. **LONG LOW HOLD** - extended breathing (Scene 6)
7. **LOW coast** - approaching end (Scenes 7-8)
8. **MINIMAL resolve** - stillness for ending (Scene 9)

---

### SUBJECT TRANSFORMATION TYPES

| Type | Example | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| POSITION | Bird rises through frame | Opening hook |
| STATE (color) | Yellow → Red canary | Emotional shift mid-story |
| SCALE | Large bird → tiny figures | Perspective shift |
| NONE | Static holds | Breathing moments (majority) |

**Key insight:** Most scenes have **NO subject transformation** - they hold. Only 2-3 scenes have significant change.

---

### WHERE TRANSFORMATION HAPPENS

| Scene | Has Transformation? | Type |
|-------|---------------------|------|
| 1 | YES | Position (subject moves through frame) |
| 2 | NO | Hold |
| 3 | YES | State (color change) |
| 4 | NO | Hold |
| 5 | YES | Position (parallax) |
| 6 | MINIMAL | Subtle zoom |
| 7 | NO | Hold |
| 8 | NO | Hold |
| 9 | NO | Hold |

**Ratio:** 3 scenes with real transformation, 6 scenes with holds = **1:2 ratio**

---

### PLACEMENT OF MEDITATIVE MOMENTS

```
Story Progress:  0%----25%----50%----75%----100%
                 |     |      |      |      |
Scene 4 (REST)   ·····█······ ·      ·      ·   (~35%)
Scene 6 (LONG)   ·     ·     ████████·      ·   (~55-70%)
Scene 9 (END)    ·     ·      ·      ·     ██   (~90-100%)
```

Meditative scenes are placed:
- After opening hook (~35% - Scene 4)
- Middle-to-late section (~55-70% - Scene 6)
- Resolution (~90%+ - Scene 9)

---

### SCENE DURATION VS MOTION INTENSITY

| Duration | Motion | Function |
|----------|--------|----------|
| SHORT (1000-1400px) | HIGH or MEDIUM | Action, transition |
| MEDIUM (1500-2000px) | LOW or HIGH | Standard scene |
| LONG (2000-2700px) | LOW or MINIMAL | Breathing, meditation |

**Rule:** Long duration = Low motion. Short duration can have high motion.

## PART 2: INDIVIDUAL SCENE DEFINITIONS

---

## CAPSULE #1 - FULL SCENE MAP

| Scene | Scroll px | Duration | Motion Type | Element Count | Palette |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | 0-1900 | 1900 | SUBJECT ANIMATION | 1 (bird) | Warm red + cold grey |
| 2 | 1900-3800 | 1900 | ATMOSPHERIC HOLD | 1 (cityscape) | Cold grey |
| 3 | 3800-5700 | 1900 | HOLD + STATE CHANGE | 1 (canary) | Warm amber |
| 4 | 5700-7900 | 2200 | ATMOSPHERIC HOLD | 2 (tiny figures) | Cold grey |

| 6 | 9300-12000 | 2700 | HOLD + SUBTLE ZOOM | 2 (people) | Warm sepia |
| 7 | 12000-13000 | 1000 | ATMOSPHERIC HOLD | 1 (figure) | Cold blue |
| 8 | 13000-14500 | 1500 | ATMOSPHERIC HOLD | 2 (figures) | Grey fog |
| 9 | 14500-end | 2400 | STATIC | 1 (envelope) | Grey/BW |

---

## MOTION TYPE DEFINITIONS

### 1. SUBJECT ANIMATION
**Definition:** Single subject moves through frame on scroll; background static.

**Structure:**
- 1 animated subject
- 1 static background layer
- Subject follows path: enters frame → traverses → exits frame
- Background: 0% movement
- Subject: 100% movement (scroll-driven)

**Example:** Bird enters bottom, rises through frame, exits top as user scrolls.

**Duration:** 1500-2000px scroll

---

### 2. ATMOSPHERIC HOLD
**Definition:** Scene largely static; atmospheric elements (fog, particles, light) provide subtle life.

**Structure:**
- 0-2 static subjects
- 1 atmospheric layer (fog, haze, particles)
- Subjects: 0% movement
- Atmosphere: 5-10% subtle drift

**Example:** Cityscape with drifting fog; figures in mist.

**Duration:** 1000-2500px scroll

---

### 3. PARALLAX
**Definition:** Multiple elements at different depths move at different rates on scroll.

**Structure:**
- 3+ elements at different Z-depths
- Foreground: moves faster
- Midground: moves medium
- Background: moves slowest or static

**Example:** Hanging cages at different distances, shifting relative to each other.

**Duration:** 1000-1500px scroll

---

### 4. STATE CHANGE
**Definition:** Same subject, same composition, but element changes state (color, form, position).

**Structure:**
- 1 subject
- Subject transforms at specific scroll point
- Composition unchanged
- Signals emotional/narrative shift

**Example:** Yellow canary → red canary (same cage, color shift).

**Trigger:** Mid-scene, aligned with text change

---

### 5. SUBTLE ZOOM
**Definition:** Very slow camera push-in or pull-out over scene duration.

**Structure:**
- Scene enlarges ~5-15% over full scroll
- Subjects static within frame
- Creates "drawing in" feeling

**Duration:** 2000-3000px scroll (slow)

---

## COMPOSITION PATTERNS

### A. SUBJECT DOMINANCE (50%+)
- Single subject fills 50-70% of visual area
- Background minimal or atmospheric
- Use for: Introduction, emphasis, intimacy

### B. NEGATIVE SPACE DOMINANCE (90%+)
- Subject is tiny (<10% of frame)
- Vast empty space surrounds
- Use for: Isolation, insignificance, scale, meditation

### C. FRAME WITHIN FRAME
- Element contains or frames another element
- Creates layered depth
- Use for: Complexity, voyeurism, multiple realities

### D. CENTER FOCUS
- Subject perfectly centered
- Minimal other elements
- Use for: Resolution, stillness, importance, endings

---

## ELEMENT COUNT RULES

| Count | When to Use | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Opening, closing, emphasis | Focus, clarity |
| 2 | Relationship, dialogue | Connection, tension |
| 3+ | Complexity, depth | Richness, parallax possible |
| Never >4 | Always | Overwhelm, distraction |

---

## PALETTE RHYTHM

**Rule:** Alternate warm and cold between scenes.

```
WARM → COLD → WARM → COLD → WARM → COLD
```

| Temperature | Colors | Emotional Register |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| WARM | Red, amber, sepia, gold | Hope, intimacy, memory |
| COLD | Grey, blue, teal | Isolation, technology, danger |

**Within-scene shift:** Palette can shift within one scene to mark emotional turn.

---

## SCENE DURATION FORMULA

**Average:** ~1700px per scene

| Scene Type | Duration Range |
|------------|----------------|
| Subject Animation | 1500-2000px |
| Atmospheric Hold | 1000-2500px |
| Parallax | 1000-1500px |
| State Change | 1500-2000px (change at midpoint) |
| Ending/Bookend | 2000-2500px |

**Story total:** ~12,000-17,000px for 9-10 scenes

---

## TRANSITION RULES

1. **Always hard cut** - no crossfades
2. **Palette shift creates bridge** - warm→cold or cold→warm
3. **Visual motif can echo** - same element type returns later (birds→envelope)
4. **Text section often aligns** - new heading = new scene

---

## BOOKEND STRATEGY

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| ECHO | Same visual category, transformed | Bird (start) → Envelope (end) |
| CONTRAST | Opposite visual/emotional | Darkness → Light |
| LITERAL RETURN | Same composition, changed state | Platform empty → Platform reunion |

---

## THE RHYTHM FORMULA

For a ~15,000px scroll story:

```
Scene 1: SUBJECT ANIMATION (hook, movement) - 1800px
Scene 2: ATMOSPHERIC HOLD (settle, context) - 1800px
Scene 3: HOLD + STATE CHANGE (shift, payoff) - 1800px
Scene 4: NEGATIVE SPACE HOLD (breathe, scale) - 2000px
Scene 5: PARALLAX (complexity, depth) - 1400px
Scene 6: SUBTLE ZOOM (intimacy, draw in) - 2500px
Scene 7: ATMOSPHERIC HOLD (tension) - 1200px
Scene 8: ATMOSPHERIC HOLD (approach end) - 1500px
Scene 9: STATIC CENTER (resolution) - 2000px
```

**Motion variety:** Not every scene needs complex motion. Mix:
- 1-2 scenes with SUBJECT ANIMATION or PARALLAX (high effort)
- 5-6 scenes with ATMOSPHERIC HOLD (medium effort)
- 1-2 scenes with STATIC or SUBTLE ZOOM (low effort)

---

## KEY INSIGHT

**What makes it work isn't constant motion - it's RHYTHM.**

- Scenes breathe (hold) then move (animate) then breathe again
- The contrast between stillness and motion creates engagement
- Too much motion = exhausting
- Too little motion = boring
- Alternation = compelling

---

## APPLYING TO PRODUCTION

When generating videos for scenes:

| Motion Type | Video Prompt Approach |
|-------------|----------------------|
| SUBJECT ANIMATION | Animate subject path, static background |
| ATMOSPHERIC HOLD | Minimal motion, fog/particle drift only |
| PARALLAX | Layer elements, different drift speeds |
| STATE CHANGE | Generate 2 variants, blend in app |
| SUBTLE ZOOM | Slow push in prompt |
| STATIC | Near-still, breathing only |

Most scenes should be ATMOSPHERIC HOLD - simple, cheap, effective.

Reserve SUBJECT ANIMATION and PARALLAX for 2-3 key moments.
