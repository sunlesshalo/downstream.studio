# Pattern: Symbolic Over Literal

**Discovered:** 2026-01-07 (Capsules analysis)
**Domain:** Visual storytelling, AI image/video generation

## The Pattern

When creating visuals to accompany narrative text, **show what the text feels like, not what it literally describes.**

## Why It Works

1. **Forgives AI imperfection** — Abstract/symbolic imagery doesn't need to match a specific expectation
2. **Creates depth** — Reader's mind fills in the connection, making it more engaging
3. **Avoids uncanny valley** — Stylized atmospherics don't trigger "something's wrong" reactions
4. **Enables reuse** — Symbolic visuals work across multiple text passages

## The Three Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **SYMBOLIC** | Default. Most scenes. | Text: "I felt overwhelmed" → Visual: Tiny figure against vast wall |
| **LITERAL** | Grounding moments, specific places | Text: "We met in Berlin" → Visual: Brandenburg Gate |
| **METAPHORICAL SYNC** | Key reveals, emotional peaks | Text: "We named it Canary" → Visual: Actual canary in cage |

## Application

When planning a visual for a text passage:

1. **First instinct** will often be literal — resist it
2. **Ask:** What is the *feeling* of this passage?
3. **Translate:** Fear → vast emptiness, small figure. Hope → warm light, ascending. Isolation → cold palette, single figure. Connection → two silhouettes, warm tones.
4. **Reserve literal** for anchor moments (1-2 per story)
5. **Use metaphorical sync** for the "aha" moment

## Examples from Capsules

| Text | Literal Would Be | Symbolic Actually Used |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| "Journalists being detained" | Person in handcuffs | Two silhouettes on cliff edge |
| "Building AI systems" | Code on screen | Child reaching for floating orbs |
| "Flooded with information" | Scrolling text | Tiny figure vs massive screen wall |
| "Supporting reflection" | Person thinking | Elderly woman with physical book |

## Anti-Pattern

❌ Text: "She walked to the coffee shop"
❌ Visual: Woman walking to coffee shop

✓ Text: "She walked to the coffee shop"
✓ Visual: Warm morning light through window, coffee cup steam rising
(Show the *feeling* of that moment, not the action)
