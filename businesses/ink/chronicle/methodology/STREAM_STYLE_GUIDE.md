# Stream Style Guide

**The definitive reference for DownStream's visual style.**

This is THE style. Not one option among many — this is what we make.

---

## WHAT IS A STREAM?

A **stream** is:
1. A scroll-driven animation that comes alive as the reader scrolls
2. A specific visual style: multi-layered, somewhat surreal, painterly

Both definitions apply. When we say "stream," we mean the format AND the aesthetic.

---

## THE VISUAL STYLE

### Core Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Multi-layered** | Scenes contain multiple elements at different depths |
| **Somewhat surreal** | Realistic elements combined with impossible/symbolic additions |
| **Painterly** | Not photorealistic — stylized, textured, atmospheric |
| **Atmospheric** | Fog, particles, grain unify and add life |

### The Two Layers

Every scene combines:

**1. REALISTIC LAYER (grounded in text)**
- Elements that depict what's literally in the scene or story
- People, places, objects mentioned or implied
- Grounded, recognizable, "could exist"

**2. SURREAL LAYER (symbolic/impossible)**
- Elements that shouldn't be there from a realistic perspective
- Recurring motifs that carry meaning across the story
- Floating objects, impossible physics, dreamlike additions

### Why This Works

The surreal layer solves the problem of non-evocative text:
- Text passage describes someone working at a desk → realistic layer
- But that's visually boring → add floating light bulbs, screens rising, cards drifting
- The surreal elements add visual interest AND can carry symbolic meaning

### Examples

| Scene | Realistic Layer | Surreal Layer |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Office | Two people at desks, laptops | Light bulbs floating through space |
| Seashore | Man walking, waves crashing, rocks | Screens rising upward |
| Train | People working on laptops, window | Landscape passing (train motion) |
| Hill | Two silhouettes walking | Debris blowing, vast scale |
| Cages | Birdcages hanging | Birds glowing/sparkling inside, cages rising |

### Recurring Motifs

Surreal elements can be **recurring motifs** that appear across the story:
- Floating screens (technology, information)
- Glowing orbs (memory, energy, ideas)
- Rising elements (hope, emergence)
- Floating cards/papers (thoughts, memories)

Choose 1-2 motifs per story and weave them through multiple scenes.

## ELEMENT INVENTORY

### 1. CAMERA MOVEMENTS

| Movement | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **ORBIT** | Camera circles around subject | Opening hooks, closing resolution |
| **PAN L→R / R→L** | Camera slides horizontally | Revealing environments, rest points |
| **PUSH IN** | Camera moves toward subject | Building intensity, intimacy |
| **PULL BACK** | Camera moves away from subject | Revealing scale, showing context |
| **DRIFT** | Floating camera, no fixed direction | Dreamlike sequences, atmospheric holds |
| **STATIC** | No camera movement | When subject/environment motion carries the scene |

**Rules:**
- Opening: Use maximum dynamism (orbit or camera+subject)
- Never repeat same camera movement in consecutive scenes
- STATIC is valid — explicitly state it

---

### 2. SUBJECT MOVEMENTS

| Movement | Description | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Flying/wings beating** | Bird in flight | High energy, good for hooks |
| **Walking into distance** | Figures moving away (Z-axis) | Creates depth, journey feeling |
| **Head turn** | Subject turns head | Draws attention |
| **Breathing** | Expansion/contraction of body | Adds life to otherwise static subjects |
| **Pose change** | Body position changes through scene | Tells micro-story |
| **Arms raised/lowered** | Gestural movement | Wonder, receiving, reaching |
| **Writing/working** | Hands at task | Creative/productive moments |
| **Pages flipping** | Book pages turn | Life in static object |
| **Door opening/closing** | Mechanical scroll response | Interactive, engages viewer |

**Rules:**
- Subjects don't need to move if camera or environment moves
- Breathing adds life to any "static" subject
- Be specific: "pages flipping" not "book moving"

---

### 3. ENVIRONMENT/ATMOSPHERIC ELEMENTS

| Element | Motion | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Debris/particles** | Blowing L→R or R→L | Wind, atmosphere |
| **Fog/mist** | Drifting | Depth, mystery, softness |
| **Clouds** | Slow drift or static | Sky atmosphere |
| **Floating screens** | Drift in space | Digital/tech themes |
| **Floating orbs** | Rise upward, drift | Magic, memories, wonder |
| **Floating cards/papers** | Drift, flutter | Thoughts, memories |
| **Light rays** | Animate with scroll | Door/window reveals |
| **Landscape passing** | Background moves | Train window effect, journey |
| **Rising elements** | Move upward | Hope, emergence |
| **Paper birds on strings** | Gentle swaying | Delicate, handcrafted |

**Rules:**
- Environment motion can carry a scene when subject/camera are static
- Multi-directional motion (subject Z + environment X) creates depth
- Particles/debris are cheap motion that adds life

---

### 4. COLOR STATES

| State | Description | Use For |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **SATURATED/COLORED** | Full color, vibrant | Hooks, high-impact moments |
| **B&W / GREY** | Desaturated, monochrome | Transitions, rest points |
| **MUTED / SEPIA** | Warm but subdued | Intimate moments, interiors |
| **WARM (golden/amber)** | Amber, golden light | Emotional warmth, memories |
| **COLD (teal/cyan)** | Blue-green atmosphere | Digital, contemplative, contrast |

### Color Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Warm subject / Cold background** | Maximum attention on subject |
| **Cold interior / Warm light outside** | Door/window reveals |
| **Alternating warm/cold** | Rhythm, prevents monotony |
| **Color shift within scene** | Yellow → amber → red transformation |

### Color Rhythm Patterns

**Capsule 1:** COLORED → B&W → COLORED → B&W → COLORED → MUTED → MUTED → GREY → GREY
**Capsule 2:** COLORED → COLD → GREY → GREY → WARM → WARM → WARM → WARM → WARM → WARM → COLD → WARM → WARM

**Rules:**
- Opening: Saturated color for the hook
- Don't repeat same color state more than 2x consecutively in early scenes
- Closing: Can be warm OR muted/grey (both work for resolution)

---

### 5. SURREAL ADDITIONS

| Addition | Description | Effect |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Impossible placement** | Bird ON cage (not inside) | Subtle wrongness |
| **Impossible physics** | Floating screens, cards, orbs | Dreamlike |
| **Scale distortion** | Giant moon, tiny figures | Awe, wonder |
| **Energy tendrils** | Lightning from magical object | Power, magic |
| **Visible memories** | Orbs containing faces | Abstract made literal |
| **Color transformation** | Subject changes color through scroll | Surreal time |

---

### 6. STATE CHANGES

| Change | Description | Trigger |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Lights appearing** | Dark elements illuminate | Scroll progress |
| **Elements emerging** | Things appear and rise | Scroll progress |
| **Symbols appearing** | Hearts, icons materialize | Scroll progress |
| **Orbs appearing** | Memory orbs around figure | Scroll progress |

**Rules:**
- Not in initial keyframe — emerges through scroll
- Powerful for "reveal" moments
- Can sync with specific text passages

---

### 7. INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Door** | Opens on scroll down, closes on scroll up |
| **Window** | Same mechanic |
| **Book** | Opens/closes with scroll |
| **Eyes** | Open/close with scroll |
| **Curtains** | Part/close with scroll |

**Rules:**
- Object IS the subject (not background)
- Responds bidirectionally to scroll
- Creates engagement, viewer plays with it

---

### 8. COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES

| Technique | Description | Use For |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Subject dominance** | Subject fills 60%+ of frame | Introduction, emphasis |
| **Extreme negative space** | Tiny figures, vast environment | Scale, meditation |
| **Frame-within-frame** | Doorway/window frames subject | Complexity, voyeurism |
| **Layered depth** | Multiple elements at different Z | Parallax, richness |
| **Center focus** | Subject centered, minimal distraction | Resolution, importance |
| **Two figures together** | Pair in scene | Relationship, collaboration |

---

### 9. SUBJECTS

**Living:**
- Birds (cardinal, canary, generic)
- Human silhouettes (single, pair, tiny, profile)
- Human figures (at desk, working, reading)
- Elder figures (wisdom, resolution)
- Young figures (energy, reaching)

**Objects:**
- Birdcages
- Doors/windows
- Books
- Laptops/screens
- Glowing orbs
- Envelope
- Lantern
- Vase with flowers

**Environments:**
- Cityscape silhouette
- Hill/cliff with figures
- Interior workspace
- Train interior
- Digital void/underwater
- Wall of papers/photos
- Rocks by water
- Window with light
- Giant moon

---

### 10. TEXTURE/OVERLAY

| Texture | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Film grain** | Unifies, adds warmth, hides AI artifacts |
| **Smudgy overlay** | Adds interest to simple scenes |
| **Paper texture** | Painterly, handcrafted feel |

**Rule:** Apply consistently across all scenes in a stream.

---

## SCENE CONSTRUCTION

### Multi-Layer Assembly

Every scene is constructed from layers:

```
LAYER 4: Texture/overlay (grain, paper)
LAYER 3: Surreal additions (floating elements, impossible physics)
LAYER 2: Environment (background, atmosphere, particles)
LAYER 1: Subject (primary focus)
LAYER 0: Camera (how we view it all)
```

### What Can Move?

Multiple elements can move simultaneously:

| Scene | Camera | Subject | Environment | Surreal |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Elder woman | Orbiting | Raising book | Static | — |
| Silhouettes on hill | Static | Walking away (Z) | Debris blowing (X) | — |
| Cages | Static | Birds flapping | Cages rising | Sparks/glow |
| Train | Static | Working | Landscape passing | Light bulbs floating |
| Seashore | Static | Walking | Waves crashing | Screens rising |

### Motion Budget

- **Opening:** Maximum motion (camera + subject + environment all can move)
- **Middle scenes:** Usually 1-2 elements moving
- **Closing:** Can match opening (orbit + subject) or be still (breathing only)

### Scene Checklist

Every scene needs:
- [ ] Primary subject (what viewer looks at)
- [ ] At least one secondary element (context, depth)
- [ ] Color decision (warm/cold/muted)
- [ ] At least one motion source (camera OR subject OR environment)
- [ ] Optional: surreal addition
- [ ] Optional: state change
- [ ] Optional: interactive behavior

---

## RHYTHM & PACING

### Motion Intensity Pattern

```
Scene 1:  HIGH    (hook — camera + subject moving)
Scene 2:  LOW     (breathe — atmospheric hold)
Scene 3:  LOW+    (hold with punctuation — state change possible)
Scene ~35%: MIN   (deepest rest — meditation)
Scene ~50%: MED   (complexity returns — parallax or animation)
Scene ~65%: LOW   (coasting)
Scene ~80%: LOW   (approaching end)
Final:    MIN/MED (resolution — still or elegant orbit)
```

### Opening Hook (Critical)

**Why this matters:** Minimal/abstract openings cause bounces. Users may:
- Think the video didn't load
- Bounce before discovering the experience
- Miss that scrolling triggers animation

**The rule:** First frame must have EITHER:
1. **Colorful + animated primary subject** (bird flying, figure moving)
2. **Static subject + dynamic surroundings** (silhouette + moving clouds/particles)

**Never:** Static subject + static surroundings (e.g., dot on black void)

| Stream | Opening | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Capsule #1 | Red bird flying through grey clouds | Instant engagement |
| Capsule #2 | Youth with glowing tech orb, orbit camera | Clear focal point |
| The Loop | Warm dot on black void | Too minimal, risks bounce |

**Prompt examples:**

DON'T:
```
single point of warm light in infinite void
```

DO:
```
single point of warm light in infinite void,
surrounded by slowly drifting particles of golden dust,
subtle atmospheric haze catching light
```

Or:
```
warm glowing orb pulsing gently,
radiating soft amber light rays,
surrounded by swirling motes of light
```

**Motion prompt for opening:** Always include camera movement:
- "slow zoom in"
- "gentle camera push"
- "orbit around subject"

Never rely only on subject motion for openings.

### Never Repeat Rule

- Don't use same camera movement in consecutive scenes
- Don't use same color state more than 2x consecutively
- Variety prevents monotony

### Bookend Strategy

| Type | Opening | Closing |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Contrast + Echo** | Saturated/moving/alive | Muted/still/object |
| **Transformation** | Young + digital + reaching | Elder + analog + present |
| **Technique Echo** | Orbit camera | Orbit camera |

Both opening and closing can have high motion — they should RELATE to each other.

---

## SYMBOLIC OVER LITERAL

**Default mode:** Show what the text FEELS like, not what it literally describes.

| Mode | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **SYMBOLIC** | Default. Most scenes. | "I felt overwhelmed" → Tiny figure against vast wall |
| **LITERAL** | Grounding moments | "We met in Berlin" → Brandenburg Gate |
| **METAPHORICAL SYNC** | Key reveals | "We named it Canary" → Actual canary |

**Anti-pattern:**
- Text: "She walked to the coffee shop"
- BAD: Woman walking to coffee shop
- GOOD: Warm morning light through window, steam rising

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### What Works for AI Generation

| Works Well | Avoid |
|------------|-------|
| Silhouettes | Detailed faces |
| Fog, mist, atmosphere | Sharp details |
| Negative space | Crowded compositions |
| Texture (wood, fabric, stone) | Smooth surfaces |
| Warm/cold extremes | Neutral mid-tones |
| Single focal point | Multiple competing subjects |

### Style Anchors (consistent references)

| Reference | What It Brings |
|-----------|----------------|
| Gregory Crewdson | Staged reality, cinematic lighting |
| Andrew Wyeth | Golden hour, loneliness, texture |
| Terrence Malick | Natural light, atmosphere |
| Film grain | Analog feel, hides AI artifacts |

## THIS IS THE STYLE

This document defines what a DownStream stream looks like.

When in doubt:
- Multi-layered (realistic + surreal)
- Painterly (not photorealistic)
- Atmospheric (fog, grain, texture)
- Symbolic (feeling over literal)
- Multiple elements moving in harmony

Once we have mastery of this style, we can explore others. For now, this is what we make.
