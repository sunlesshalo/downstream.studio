## PHASE 3: DETAILED SCENE ANALYSIS

### Scene 1: THE ORB

**Scroll range:** 0-700px
**Duration:** 700px
**Color state:** COLORED (teal background + amber orb)
**Intensity:** HIGH

**Visual Composition:**
- Primary subject: Young person holding glowing orb
- Secondary elements: Lightning/energy tendrils from orb, clouds
- Tertiary: Dark teal sky
- Composition: Subject center-bottom, orb draws focus

**Color:**
- Dominant: Dark teal sky, bright amber/gold orb
- Temperature: COLD background, WARM focal point
- Maximum contrast for attention (like Capsule #1 Scene 1)

**Motion Analysis (from frame comparison 0→100→200→300→400→500→600→700):**
- Camera: ORBITS around subject (view shifts from behind-side → profile → behind again)
- Subject: POSE CHANGES (arms raised high → lowered to chest, gaze shifts down to orb)
- Environment: Clouds static or minimal drift
- Motion type: **Camera + Subject** (both moving — highest dynamism)

**Surreal/Special Elements:**
- Lightning/energy tendrils emanating from orb
- Orb glows unnaturally bright

**What makes this scene work:**
The camera orbit creates dynamism while the subject's pose change tells a micro-story (reaching up → contemplating). The amber orb against teal sky creates maximum color contrast for hook.

## PHASE 4: PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Color Pattern

| Scene | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|
| Color | C | COLD | GREY | GREY | WARM | WARM | WARM | WARM | WARM | WARM | COLD | WARM | WARM |

**Pattern:** Opening colored hook → Cold digital → Grey transition → Long warm middle → Cold return → Warm resolution

### Motion Strategy

| 1 | Orbit | Pose change | Static | Camera+Subject |
| 2 | Drift | Static | Screens float | Camera+Env |
| 3 | Subtle | Static | Subtle | Hold |
| 4 | Zoom | Static | Static | Hold |
| 5 | Push | Writing | Static | Camera+Subject |
| 6 | Pan | Static | Landscape passes | Env motion |
| 7 | Pull | Static | Static | Hold |
| 8 | Push | Arms raised | Orbs rise | State change |
| 9 | Subtle | Static | Birds sway | Env motion |
| 10 | Drift | Static | Cards float | Env motion |
| 11 | Static | Static | Screens | Hold |

| Digital/Cold | 2-4 | MEDIUM→LOW |
| Warm middle | 5-10 | MEDIUM (varied) |
| Cold return | 11 | MEDIUM |
| Resolution | 12-13 | LOW |

**Pattern:** Front-loaded effort, but with HIGH moment mid-stream (Scene 8 floating orbs). Resolution is quiet.

### Bookend Analysis

| Aspect | Opening (Scene 1) | Closing (Scene 13) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Subject | Young person | Elder woman |
| Object | Glowing orb | Physical book |
| Color | Teal + amber | Warm golden |

## PHASE 6: PRODUCTION INSIGHTS

### Key Techniques

1. **Bookend transformation:** Young/digital → Elder/analog tells complete arc
2. **Long warm middle:** Creates emotional safety after cold opening
3. **State change scenes:** Floating orbs appearing creates magic moment
4. **Environment motion:** Landscape passing, birds swaying — motion without complex animation
5. **Return to cold:** Scene 11 breaks warm monotony, creates rhythm

### Patterns to Follow

1. **Color rhythm:** Don't stay in one temperature too long. Capsule #2 stays warm for 6 scenes (5-10) but breaks with cold Scene 11
2. **Front-load the hook:** Scene 1 has maximum dynamism (camera + subject)
3. **Rest points exist:** Scenes 3-4 (grey, long, meditative) give breathing room
4. **Surreal additions throughout:** Not just opening — Scene 8, 9, 10 all have surreal elements

### Differences from Capsule #1

| Aspect | Capsule #1 | Capsule #2 |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Scenes | 9 | 13 |
| Total length | ~14,500px | ~21,200px |
| Cold/Grey scenes | More alternating | Concentrated (2-4, 11) |
| Warm scenes | Distributed | Long middle block |
| Photorealistic moments | Scene 6 (desk) | Scene 13 (elder) |
| B&W usage | Alternating | Concentrated block |

### Things to Consider

1. **13 scenes is manageable** for longer content
2. **Long warm sections work** if punctuated
3. **One photorealistic closing scene** works as resolution
4. **Surreal elements** can appear mid-stream, not just opening
