Sections:
- "CAPSULES DEEP DIVE: Animation & Scene Transitions" (Capsule #1)
- "CAPSULE #2 ANALYSIS: Friendship LLM"

## Quick Reference

### Capsule #1: "Canary Trigger"
- **Theme:** Tech/security product announcement
- **Length:** ~12,100px scroll, 10 scenes, ~2500 words
- **Style:** High contrast, red accent color, symbolic imagery
- **Bookend:** Bird → Envelope (echo motif)

### Capsule #2: "Friendship LLM"
- **Theme:** Personal/philosophical, AI + human connection
- **Length:** ~15,400px scroll, 14 scenes, ~3000 words
- **Style:** Richer gradients, more photorealistic moments
- **Bookend:** Youth+tech orb → Elder+book (contrast motif)

## Key Insights

1. **~200-250 words per scene** is the target
2. **Symbolic > Literal** — visuals show feeling, not events
3. **Motion is subtle** — fog, drift, breathing, not action
4. **Color temperature = emotion** — warm for intimacy, cold for tension
5. **Atmospheric elements** hide AI imperfections
6. **Bookends** can echo (same motif) or contrast (transformation)
