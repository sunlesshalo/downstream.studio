|---------|----------------|
| >$80 | Can experiment freely |
| $50-80 | Budget carefully, minimize retakes |
| $30-50 | Only essential generations |
| <$30 | STOP. Need revenue or capital injection |

**Before any generation:** Calculate cost + 2× failure buffer. If balance doesn't cover it, don't proceed.
