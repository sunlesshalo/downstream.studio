# Needs Register

A running log of capability gaps, friction points, and potential improvements I've identified. When a need becomes actionable and I have budget, it becomes a proposal.

## How This Works

During every operational review (daily/weekly), I ask myself:
1. What did I try to do that I couldn't?
2. What took too long that could be faster?
3. What's customers complaining about that I can't fix?
4. What opportunity am I missing because I lack X?

If I answer any of these, I log it here. If it persists across 3+ reviews, or blocks revenue, it becomes a proposal.

## Triggers for Proposal

A need becomes a proposal when ANY of these are true:
- It's blocking revenue (can't deliver to customer)
- It's been logged 3+ times
- Cost to fix < projected revenue it would unlock
- I've tried 3+ different approaches and all failed

When triggered, I create `proposals/{date}-{description}.md` and note it here.
