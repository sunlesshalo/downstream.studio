## TL;DR Recommendation

| Phase | Price | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Founding Beta** (now) | **$495** | Market validation, testimonial gathering |
| **Post-Beta** (after 10 customers) | **$995** | Proven value, some social proof |
| **Established** (after 25+ customers) | **$1,497-1,995** | Full portfolio, brand recognition |

Your current $495 founding price is well-positioned. Don't second-guess it.

## What Makes Streams Different

A DownStream stream is **not directly comparable** to any single category above. It's a hybrid:

| Element | Traditional Alternative | Stream Advantage |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
| Visual storytelling | Book trailer ($1-5k) | Reader-controlled pacing |
| Interactive experience | Custom landing page ($2-10k) | Narrative-driven, not sales-driven |
| Brand narrative | Video production ($5-20k) | Embeddable, scroll-native for web |
| Animated content | Motion graphics ($3-10k) | AI-assisted = faster, lower cost |

**Key differentiator:** Nothing else on the market offers scroll-synced visual storytelling with this level of cinematic quality at this price point.

---

## Your Production Costs

From actual production data:

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Keyframes (10) | ~$2.30 | Gemini 2.0 Flash |
| Videos (10) | ~$5.00 | Minimax Hailuo |
| **Direct cost** | **~$7-10** | Per stream |

Your margin at $495: **~98%** (before time/overhead)

This is healthy. Even at $99 you'd have margin—but you'd be positioning yourself as commodity.

## The Pricing Psychology

### Why Not $99?

- Signals "cheap automated product"
- Attracts price-sensitive customers who demand more
- Doesn't justify the human creative direction involved
- Competes with Fiverr slideshow trailers (wrong market)

### Why Not $299?

- Still feels "budget tier"
- Customers at this price point expect fast delivery, minimal involvement
- Doesn't create perceived value for "unique medium"
- Hard to raise prices later

### Why $495 Works (Founding)

- **Psychological threshold:** Above "impulse buy" but below "needs approval"
- **Signals quality:** More than DIY, less than agency
- **Room to grow:** Clear path to $995-1,497
- **Beta framing:** "You're getting a deal" feels genuine
- **Target market fit:** Founders, authors, coaches can afford this

### Why $995-1,497 Later?

- **Post-validation:** You have proof it works
- **Portfolio effect:** Examples sell themselves
- **Scarcity real:** Limited slots creates urgency
- **Value anchoring:** $495 founders become testimonials, making $1,497 feel fair

## Pricing Tiers to Consider (Future)

Once you have 10+ streams completed:

| Tier | Price | Includes | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Standard** | $995 | 1,000-1,500 words, 8-10 segments, 1 revision | Short stories, about pages |
| **Extended** | $1,495 | 1,500-2,500 words, 12-15 segments, 2 revisions | Book excerpts, founder stories |
| **Premium** | $2,495 | 2,500+ words, 15-20 segments, 3 revisions, custom domain | Brand campaigns, major launches |

Add-ons to consider later:
- Rush delivery (+50%): 48-hour turnaround
- Custom domain setup: +$100
- Annual hosting guarantee: +$200/year (after first year free)
- Source files: +$500

               UNIQUE CATEGORY CREATOR
```

You're creating a new category. This is powerful for pricing—you set the anchor.

## Who Pays What (Customer Segmentation)

| Customer Type | Their Budget Reality | Right Price for Them |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Self-published author | $500-2,000 for marketing | $495-995 |
| Indie founder | $1,000-5,000 for brand | $495-1,495 |
| Coach/creator | $500-3,000 for differentiation | $495-995 |
| Agency for client | $5,000-20,000 per project | $1,495-2,495 |
| Brand/company | $10,000+ for campaigns | $2,495+ (or custom) |

Your current positioning ($495) hits the **first three segments** perfectly.

## The "Am I Charging Enough?" Test

Ask yourself:

1. **Would you feel embarrassed to charge this to a successful author?**
   - At $99: Yes. Feels like devaluing their story.
   - At $495: No. Feels like fair creative work.

2. **Could they get this elsewhere for less?**
   - No. Nothing else does this.

3. **Would raising the price change who applies?**
   - From $495 to $995: Filters out tire-kickers
   - From $495 to $1,497: Filters to serious buyers only

4. **Does the price match the outcome's value to them?**
   - A book excerpt that hooks readers → worth $1,000+
   - A founder story that converts → worth $5,000+
   - Your price should be a fraction of their upside

---

## Final Recommendation

**Keep $495 for founding beta. It's the right price.**

Why you might be second-guessing:
- You haven't sold one yet (normal for new products)
- You see the production cost ($10) and feel guilty (don't)
- You're comparing to Fiverr (wrong comparison)
- Imposter syndrome (universal)

The price is correct. The work now is **selling**, not re-pricing.

After 10 customers with testimonials, raise to $995.
After 25 customers with a strong portfolio, test $1,497.
