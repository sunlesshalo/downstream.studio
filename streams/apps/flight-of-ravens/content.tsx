      <h1>Flight of Ravens</h1>

      <p>The end of the world arrived simultaneously with the disappearance of the ravens. Most people, of course, did not even notice the absence of the black birds. How could one expect humanity to devote its attention to an already dwindling species while the end of days stood upon the threshold? Yet, apocalypse or no, nothing in the world changed; and what did change, most people—naturally—failed to notice.</p>

      <p>In terms of attentiveness and interest shown toward ravens, reprobus was no different from the rest. Yes, reprobus—just like that, with a lowercase letter—for now he could be any reprobus, one who, caught between the two available possibilities, has not become, or at least has not yet become, either.</p>

      <p>So, this reprobus, caring nothing for the end of the world that had been raging—quietly, yet ferociously—for days or perhaps months, set the hauling of life's small, methodically collected burdens as his life's purpose. As soon as he arrived from one place to the next, he immediately set off again, or back, if the situation required. Burdens, after all, exist to be borne, carried, and dragged.</p>

      <p>One morning, when the rivers had already swollen heavily from the constant rain, and perhaps a few leaden snowflakes had mingled with the droplets, reprobus did not appear to collect his daily load. The burdens assigned to him sat orphaned for a long time on a riverbank; eventually, because no one showed a willingness to carry them to the far side, the river itself reached out for them and floated them away on a night of the full moon.</p>

      <p>By the time the flood had swept away the evidence of reprobus's absence, everyone had already learned of his disappearance, and thus, everyone began to forget him.</p>

      <p>His acquaintances spent a few days pondering the cause of his absence, but in the end, they all satisfied themselves with some plucked-from-the-air explanation: that reprobus had been overcome by laziness, or had broken a leg, or perhaps a hand. There was even a morbid suggestion that reprobus had floated, rafted, or perhaps sailed away on one of the newly flooded rivers.</p>

      <p>Yet the rising waters were hardly an index of the world's condition. The falling raindrops, the river waves, the washed-away houses, and the swept-away people were scarcely more numerous than during previous floods; thus, the water level could hardly have played a part in reprobus's disappearance—which was, beyond doubt, connected to the ongoing end of the world.</p>

      <p>And yet. The falling raindrops nourished the rivers from within, and the waters of the rivers flooded inward. People tried to hold back the water with sandbags and dams, while all the while, this inward flooding seemed to submerge the world. More precisely: nothing of it could be seen, nor could it be felt. Yet, slowly, people were suffocating.</p>

      <h2>The Voyage</h2>

      <p>It would be proper, then, to apologize for the explanation previously called "morbid" and to acknowledge the correctness of the theory of his sailing away. True, we must add: reprobus became a victim of the inward-flooding waters; it was they that floated his anchorless ship through the swollen rivers out to the open sea.</p>

      <p>So, the ship drifted on the open water, and beyond any doubt, reprobus drifted along with the ship, for his trace could be found nowhere else in the world. Therefore, reprobus had to be on the ship, but if he was there, he faced a strange journey.</p>

      <p>His nautical adventure may have been similar to the voyage of a certain Vasco Núñez de Balboa, who, in the year of our Lord fifteen hundred and nine, together with his dog named Leoncico, fled from his Santo Domingo creditors by hiding in a barrel in the hold of a ship bound for the New World.</p>

      <p>To draw a parallel between the situation of these two men is not at all arbitrary. Aside from a few small but exceedingly significant differences, the journeys unfolded very similarly indeed.</p>

      <p>First, there is the fact of the sailing itself. It is true that in the case of reprobus, it is not entirely certain we can speak of sailing, but in Balboa's case, all the more so.</p>

      <p>Then there is the barrel, which is, in essence, nothing other than an exceedingly narrow and dark hole with hard, impenetrable walls, from which nothing can be seen; where the loud events occurring on the ship—the commands to brace the sails, the thumping of sailors' feet, the discovery of new land—can only be heard in moderation.</p>

      <p>In the narrow and dark hole in which reprobus found himself, he saw not a single ray of light; he heard only a rhythmic thumping, a thundering at times, and he would not have dared to swear the sound came from sailors running to and fro.</p>

      <p>Later, as the nautical and other miles diminished, the ship—as if searching for something or someone—traveled twice the length of a river that, since the beginning of time, had only ever been crossed, and even then, mostly by a single ferryman.</p>

      <p>Perhaps on the bank of this very river, or another into which this one flowed, or perhaps one that itself flowed into this river, a kind of creaking mingled with the rhythmic thundering. Unoiled, rusting iron creaks so—swings, for instance, or perhaps gate-wings swayed by the wind.</p>

      <p>Reprobus considered every imaginable possibility, yet he could not decide what might produce the sound. It would not have helped him even if he had seen how, beside a pair of rusty scales tilting with empty pans, a monster with the body of a lion and a hippopotamus, once worshipped as a god, was just then opening its massive crocodile jaws.</p>

      <p>Was it perhaps waiting for clumsy prey, or was it merely yawning its long-standing loneliness into the infinite? From the perspective of the ship's sole passenger and stowaway, it was entirely the same—and it was the same for the infinite, for eternity as well—just as the effort exerted by an awkward raven chick while trying to hatch from its egg is insignificant.</p>

      <p>From the egg, which is, in essence, nothing other than an exceedingly narrow and dark hole with hard, impenetrable walls, from which nothing can be seen.</p>

      <p>The ship moved on. Meanwhile, as an inevitable accompaniment to sea voyages conducted in barrels, seasickness paid its respects to reprobus; the situation was only worsened by the fact that, just as Balboa with Leoncico, reprobus—according to his own conviction—shared his barrel with someone or something.</p>

      <p>He was certain his traveling companion could not be a dog. He did not smell that characteristic odor known to anyone who has shared a sealed, narrow barrel with a large dog for days or weeks, nor did he manage to feel the dog anywhere.</p>

      <p>Perhaps this was the most unpleasant point of the companion's presence—specifically, that although there could be no doubt as to its existence, every attempt to find it remained unsuccessful.</p>

      <p>Thus reprobus, like the Balboa of old, locked in a barrel languishing in the belly of a ship, sharing the cramped space with his companion, drifted toward an unknown destination. That is, not entirely unknown, for before his escape from Santo Domingo, Balboa had already visited the shores of the New World once—but that is irrelevant now.</p>

      <p>What may prove significant, however, is that Balboa and his ilk, through the discovery and conquest of the New World, assisted at one, or rather two, ends of the world at once; though it is indisputable that fate also assigned them the role of midwife. Perhaps it was the midwifing that caused events in Balboa's time to occur far more spectacularly and loudly than the disappearance of the ravens on the solemn occasion of another end of the world.</p>

      <p>But if we have come to the differences, then the most important divergence between Balboa's and reprobus's journey must be mentioned. It is none other than this: at the end of the voyage, Balboa arrived in the New World, but when the hull of reprobus's ship struck some kind of reef, and reprobus with great difficulty scrambled out of his barrel, he found himself in the very river from whose bank, once, long ago, he had failed to collect his daily burdens awaiting their carrier.</p>

      <p>And the river, while it swept the burdens along and flooded both outward and inward, was seeking either a new or an old bed; but it is certain that the bank upon which reprobus stood after his return was not the bank from which that thing had once snatched him.</p>

      <p>Of course, it is possible that our line of reasoning thus far is entirely flawed, because reprobus did not sail out locked in a dark barrel, but rather a whale—swimming as far as the city in the waters of the inward-flooded oceans—swallowed him while our hero was sleeping the sleep of the just or performing some other activity.</p>

      <h2>The Fool and the Raven</h2>

      <p>After he found the city, or rather the city found him, his former acquaintances—who now felt equally foreign—received him with disbelief. They laughed at the story of his journey; they took him for a fool.</p>

      <p>For a time, they tried to persuade him to tell the "true" story, in which he had been wallowing drunk in the bottom of some ditch, or perhaps hiding under a skirt, unwilling to leave good company; but reprobus proved adamant.</p>

      <p>In their helplessness, the townspeople held a solemn ceremony and appointed reprobus the city's First Fool. Daily, they made him tell the story of his voyage over and over again, simply so they could take pleasure in the foolish tale.</p>

      <p>Reprobus accepted his new task more gratefully than anyone expected. It angered him that, although he had returned to his former home, that home proved foreign to him; and that if he sometimes woke from a dream in which he was again tossing as a prisoner of the barrel, then instead of terror, only a kind of—there is perhaps no better word for it—homesickness overcame him.</p>

      <p>His anger prompted him to throw himself into the playing of his new role. The more and the better he told his tales, the more contentedly the audience left after each story, the more familiar the world became, and the rarer the dreams.</p>

      <p>In this great exertion, reprobus grew particularly fond of the role assigned to him; meanwhile, he did not even notice that instead of the ship, he increasingly presented his story with whales and other nonsense. Eventually, he began to tell of other adventures and no longer thought of his former journey.</p>

      <p>Only the invisible companion—only that one—refused to be left out of the stories.</p>

      <p>Among his acquaintances, there remained hardly any who had not resigned themselves to reprobus's folly. Most did not understand the reason for the turn of events, yet they were glad their former acquaintance had found his place in the world again.</p>

      <p>Finally, there was only one among them—perhaps it was he who had originally devised the sailing explanation—who truly stood by reprobus. Ceaselessly, using newer and newer methods, he tried to return his friend to the reality of the everyday. He listened to, and knew by heart, almost all of reprobus's adventures.</p>

      <p>Then, during a performance at a tavern table, when the fool came forward with his latest and perhaps best story yet, the friend shouted through the loud celebration following the conclusion:</p>

      <Dialogue>
        <p>Fine! Fine, but now tell us instead about the barrel, the ship, the invisible companion, because after all, that is your true story! Look, everyone here around you believes you, though they all know that nothing you've cobbled together here ever happened. Tell us something true then, and if you really made that journey, show us something you brought back with you, because it isn't right that every story should be built upon the unreal. There must be reality too!</p>
      </Dialogue>

      <p>The crowd's loud celebration turned into a murmur of assent. They began to encourage the fool—most no longer even knew his name—to tell a story, and if he was telling one, to provide some kind of proof of the journey.</p>

      <p>And reprobus wanted to yield to the crowd's wish. <em>Now you shall see,</em> he thought, but only when he had already begun the story did he realize that, apart from hazy details, he remembered nothing.</p>

      <p><em>Something... something whale... a whale, there was that in it... no, that's another story</em>—reprobus searched through his memories. <em>Then... then a ferryman, taking some lad to the other side... no, not that either, wait...</em> he thought, <em>some fratricide, hiding in the reeds. Not that either. Perhaps something Balboa. Balboa conquers the New World, naked-bodied, with gloves on his fists he subdues evil, and even as an old man, there is no one who can defeat him. No, no, that's two others at once.</em></p>

      <p>The crowd grew increasingly impatient for the story and the proof. Reprobus was terrified by the accumulating temper and the pressure weighing down on him—weighing so, so heavily that he thought his chest would rip, would break, and through the rift, the break, his heart was preparing to be squeezed out of his body.</p>

      <p>No matter how hard he tried, the words, the sentences, would not come together in his head, and the story even less so. In his despair, reprobus himself began to doubt the reality of his journey—for how could something be real that no one knows of, that no one remembers?</p>

      <p>Finally, in the hope of escape, he surrendered. Bowing his head, he placed his jester's cap on the table.</p>

      <Dialogue>
        <p>It truly, truly, truly might be—he muttered—that there was never a whale or a ship, nor perhaps even an invisible companion, perhaps not even a barrel anywhere, and thus the journey could not have happened any other way than how most of you, my dear friends, believe you know: that while I was wallowing thoroughly drunk in a ditch, I myself invented everything I later cobbled together... but... but all this... all this only happened so because, while sober, I could no longer tell the difference between delusions and memories.</p>
      </Dialogue>

      <p>By the time he reached this point, the pressure on his chest had grown unutterably strong; he could almost hear the cracking of bones, and his words only crawled out of his throat softly, weakly. Yet he continued.</p>

      <Dialogue>
        <p>But now, now everything is fine. You can see! Now... now... now I know! I know, I know the difference, what is not, and what is!</p>
      </Dialogue>

      <p>The crowd fell silent after the confession ended. When the last sigh, the last uncomprehending grumble, even the last questioning look died away; when not a floorboard or table, nor even a chair leg creaked; when the hearts of every member of the gathered crowd beat once in unison, then fell silent together before the next beat—there was such a silence in the world as perhaps never before since the creation.</p>

      <p>And in the silence, the pressure weighing on reprobus's chest ceased.</p>

      <p>He did not even notice that before the sigh of relief could break from his body, a raven poked its head through the gaping rift in his cracked, broken chest. It hopped onto the table, surveyed the silenced crowd, then hopped further into reprobus's lap, and from there to the floor.</p>

      <p>With an awkward, swaying gait, occasionally stumbling, it moved toward the light filtering through the tavern door, which stood slightly ajar. It did not fly; the thought that it could fly did not even enter its head.</p>

      <p>How could anyone imagine that a raven could fly—one that hatches and is raised inside a human chest, and in that ever-narrowing space, has hardly enough room even to stretch its sometimes cramped and numbing wings?</p>

      <p>In the great silence, the end of the world also stalled for a moment; then, driven by the sigh breaking from reprobus's throat, it continued on.</p>
