    "original_text": "We all have a story to tell.\n\nYours might be the private promise you made yourself at a kitchen table before you ever hired your first employee. It might be the cause that is currently breaking your heart, piece by piece, yet you keep going—perhaps because you've realized that a broken heart is the entry fee for saving a small corner of the world. Or perhaps it is something more intimate: a secret you want to leave for your child, a map to help them find their way in a world that grows harder to believe in with every passing year.\n\nWe all have a story to tell.\n\nMine is about the sobering realization that not all the stories worth telling are my own.\n\nI was a storyteller for most of my life. I inhabited the world of short stories, plays, and reviews—stories about other people's stories. It was work that required a specific kind of devotion: time, craft, and an almost religious commitment to practice. But most importantly, it was work that required a witness. A story without a reader is just ink on a page; it's a circuit that never closes.\n\nThen, I stopped.\n\nI didn't stop because I ran out of things to say. I stopped because the cost of creating had grown higher than the cost of staying silent. Some people burn out in public, spectacularly. I chose a different path. I quietly stepped back and waited for a time when the pain of not writing finally outweighed the pain of writing itself.\n\nThat time hasn't come yet. But I never actually left the orbit of storytelling. I just started circling it from a safe distance—close enough to watch the flames, far enough so they couldn't bite.\n\nI moved into Marketing, where narrative is stripped down and weaponized as strategy. I explored Games, where the reader shapes the ending. I watched the rise of AI, which generates everything and means nothing by any of it.\n\nAnd the whole time, I kept seeing the same thing: people with stories that mattered—stories that deserved to land—watching their work disappear into the noise.\n\nThe Architecture of Erasure\n\nThe platforms we use to share our lives were never built for stories. They were built for attention.\n\nAttention captured. Attention measured. Attention sold.\n\nThat is the product. The algorithms do not care about meaning. They do not care about resonance. They do not care about the moment when a story finally lands and a reader thinks, yes, someone understands. They care only if you stay long enough to monetize, then redirect you to the next flickering light.\n\nThere is a layer on top of everything now—algorithmic, relentless, infinite. It decides what gets seen and what vanishes. It doesn't care if your story is true or took you a decade to shape. It cares if it stops a thumb for three seconds.\n\nYour story isn't failing because it isn't good enough. It's failing because the entire infrastructure is designed to keep people swimming—always moving, never arriving. Endless scroll. Infinite feed.\n\nBut beneath that churn, something remains.\n\nThe Yearning for the Sea\n\nThere is a line from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry that has been with me for years:\n\n\"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\"\n\nFor a long time, I didn't know what to do with that quote. It sat in the back of my mind, fueling a restlessness I couldn't name. I tried to forget it.\n\nI was building dashboards—clean, cold grids of information—when the question finally formed. If we can describe data and watch an AI draw it, why can't we do that for a story?\n\nBut stories are not data. You don't consume a story the way you consume a chart. Stories have rhythm, pacing, and weight that builds across time. The visual layer couldn't just be decoration—it had to move with the narrative.\n\nI started looking at the pieces scattered across different disciplines: image generation, video with keyframe control, scroll-driven web technology. I began assembling them into something I hadn't seen before.\n\nNot a tool. A contribution. A way to help stories land differently.\n\nIntroducing Downstream\n\nAs you scroll, the animation responds to you. Not video imposing its rhythm. Not static images sitting dead on a page. Movement that follows your lead. It holds when you pause. It lets you retreat and revisit.\n\nYou can drift through slowly if the story is meditative. Race through if the urgency demands it. When the story speaks of descent, the world on your screen descends with you.\n\nYou are no longer being fed a story. You are moving through it.\n\nThe words remain yours. My work is to build the current around them.\n\nI call it Downstream—a name born from that Saint-Exupéry yearning. You don't have to fight the water to get where you're going. You just need the right vessel.\n\nI built Downstream to be the ship that carries yearning people toward their sea—a sea that surges, swells, heaves, and roars with stories that actually matter.\n\nThe ship leaves at dawn. Join me—we're sailing downstream.",

It might be the cause that is currently breaking your heart, piece by piece, yet you keep going—perhaps because you've realized that a broken heart is the entry fee for saving a small corner of the world. Or perhaps it is something more intimate: a secret you want to leave for your child, a map to help them find their way in a world that grows harder to believe in with every passing year.\n\nWe all have a story to tell.\n\nMine is about the sobering realization that not all the stories worth telling are my own.\n\nI was a storyteller for most of my life. I inhabited the world of short stories, plays, and reviews—stories about other people's stories. It was work that required a specific kind of devotion: time, craft, and an almost religious commitment to practice. But most importantly, it was work that required a witness. A story without a reader is just ink on a page; it's a circuit that never closes."

Some people burn out in public, spectacularly. I chose a different path. I quietly stepped back and waited for a time when the pain of not writing finally outweighed the pain of writing itself.\n\nThat time hasn't come yet. But I never actually left the orbit of storytelling. I just started circling it from a safe distance—close enough to watch the flames, far enough so they couldn't bite.\n\nI moved into Marketing, where narrative is stripped down and weaponized as strategy. I explored Games, where the reader shapes the ending. I watched the rise of AI, which generates everything and means nothing by any of it.\n\nAnd the whole time, I kept seeing the same thing: people with stories that mattered—stories that deserved to land—watching their work disappear into the noise."

They do not care about the moment when a story finally lands and a reader thinks, yes, someone understands. They care only if you stay long enough to monetize, then redirect you to the next flickering light.\n\nThere is a layer on top of everything now—algorithmic, relentless, infinite. It decides what gets seen and what vanishes. It doesn't care if your story is true or took you a decade to shape. It cares if it stops a thumb for three seconds.\n\nYour story isn't failing because it isn't good enough. It's failing because the entire infrastructure is designed to keep people swimming—always moving, never arriving. Endless scroll. Infinite feed.\n\nBut beneath that churn, something remains."

Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\"\n\nFor a long time, I didn't know what to do with that quote. It sat in the back of my mind, fueling a restlessness I couldn't name. I tried to forget it.\n\nI was building dashboards—clean, cold grids of information—when the question finally formed. If we can describe data and watch an AI draw it, why can't we do that for a story?\n\nBut stories are not data. You don't consume a story the way you consume a chart. Stories have rhythm, pacing, and weight that builds across time. The visual layer couldn't just be decoration—it had to move with the narrative.\n\nI started looking at the pieces scattered across different disciplines: image generation, video with keyframe control, scroll-driven web technology. I began assembling them into something I hadn't seen before.\n\nNot a tool. A contribution. A way to help stories land differently."

When the story speaks of descent, the world on your screen descends with you.\n\nYou are no longer being fed a story. You are moving through it.\n\nThe words remain yours. My work is to build the current around them.\n\nI call it Downstream—a name born from that Saint-Exupéry yearning. You don't have to fight the water to get where you're going. You just need the right vessel.\n\nI built Downstream to be the ship that carries yearning people toward their sea—a sea that surges, swells, heaves, and roars with stories that actually matter.\n\nThe ship leaves at dawn.
