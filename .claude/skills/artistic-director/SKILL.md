description: Creative direction for stream visuals. Use when planning visual style, developing aesthetic concepts, crafting prompts, or when user wants more creative/sophisticated imagery for a stream.

# Artistic Director - Creative Vision Skill

## Goal
Develop sophisticated, cohesive visual narratives that elevate streams beyond generic AI imagery into distinctive artistic experiences.

## When to Use
- Starting a new stream (define visual identity)
- User wants "better", "more creative", "more artistic" visuals
- Crafting prompts for generate-frames or generate-video
- Reviewing and refining visual direction
- Creating mood boards or style guides

## Core Philosophy

**Avoid:** Generic AI aesthetics (oversaturated colors, plastic textures, "epic" everything)
**Pursue:** Restraint, intentionality, emotional resonance, visual metaphor

### Color Palettes (With Emotional Mapping)

#### NARRATIVE PALETTES
```
DESCENT / TRAGEDY
├── Deep navy (#0a1628) → Foundation of void
├── Dried blood (#8b0000) → Violence remembered  
├── Bruise purple (#301934) → Accumulated damage
└── Bone white (#f5f5dc) → What remains

EMERGENCE / HOPE  
├── Pre-dawn grey (#2c3e50) → Before the light
├── Rose gold (#b76e79) → First warmth
├── Soft amber (#ffbf00) → Growing certainty
└── Clear sky (#87ceeb) → Possibility

LIMINAL / BETWEEN
├── Fluorescent green (#39ff14) → Artificial life
├── Concrete grey (#95a5a6) → Non-place
├── Dirty cream (#f5f5dc) → Institutional
└── Shadow purple (#483d8b) → What lurks

COSMIC / TRANSCENDENT
├── Void black (#0d0d0d) → Infinite nothing
├── Nebula magenta (#ff00ff) → Stellar birth
├── Cosmic teal (#008b8b) → Ancient light
└── Star white (#ffffff) → Points of meaning
```

### Composition Frameworks

#### THE GOLDEN SPIRAL
Subject at focal point, eye travels through frame following natural curve.
*Use for:* Organic subjects, contemplative moments, natural flow

#### NEGATIVE SPACE DOMINANCE
80% emptiness, 20% subject. The void speaks.
*Use for:* Isolation, insignificance, meditation, cosmic scale

#### TRIPTYCH STRUCTURE
Three distinct zones: past | present | future
*Use for:* Transformation narratives, choice moments, time passage

#### FRAME WITHIN FRAME
Doorways, windows, mirrors containing the subject.
*Use for:* Voyeuristic distance, trapped characters, multiple realities

#### DIAGONAL TENSION
Strong diagonal lines creating dynamic instability.
*Use for:* Conflict, movement, disruption, energy

### Lighting Approaches

| Technique | Mood | Implementation |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Rembrandt** | Intimate drama | Single side light, triangle on cheek |
| **Silhouette** | Mystery, anonymity | Backlit subject, no fill |
| **Practical Lights** | Grounded reality | Light sources visible in frame |
| **God Rays** | Transcendence | Volumetric light through haze |
| **Underlight** | Unease, horror | Light from below, unnatural shadows |
| **Bi-color** | Tension, duality | Warm vs cool opposing sources |

## PART 3: THE CREATIVE PROCESS

### Step 1: Narrative Excavation
Before any visual work, answer:
- What is the **emotional core** of this segment?
- What **transformation** occurs?
- What should the viewer **feel**, not just see?
- What **metaphor** could embody this?

### Step 2: Reference Gathering
Find 3-5 reference images that capture:
- The **mood** (even if subject differs)
- The **color world** 
- The **composition style**
- The **texture/materiality**

### Step 3: Style Synthesis
Combine elements deliberately:
```
[BASE STYLE] + [LIGHTING APPROACH] + [COLOR PALETTE] + [COMPOSITION]

Example: "Tarkovsky Stillness" + "Practical Lights" + "Descent Palette" + "Negative Space"
= Rain-streaked window in empty room, single lamp casting warm pool against encroaching darkness, figure small in corner
```

### Step 4: Prompt Architecture

**Structure:**
```
[SUBJECT/SCENE], [STYLE REFERENCE], 
[LIGHTING], [COLOR PALETTE],
[COMPOSITION], [ATMOSPHERE/MOOD],
[TECHNICAL QUALITIES],
[NEGATIVE ELEMENTS]
```

**Example - Weak Prompt:**
```
"A person standing in a dark room, cinematic, moody"
```

**Example - Strong Prompt:**
```
"Solitary figure silhouetted against rain-streaked window, 
Tarkovsky stillness meets Hopper isolation,
single practical lamp casting amber pool in ocean of blue-grey shadow,
negative space dominance with subject in lower third,
dust particles visible in light beam, condensation on glass,
film grain, shallow depth of field, anamorphic lens characteristics,
avoid: sharp details on face, modern elements, saturated colors"
```

### Step 5: Motion Direction (for video)
Define movement with intention:

| Movement Type | Emotional Effect |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Static hold** | Contemplation, tension, reverence |
| **Slow push in** | Growing intimacy or dread |
| **Slow pull out** | Revelation, isolation, perspective |
| **Gentle drift** | Dream state, memory, timelessness |
| **Parallax layers** | Depth, immersion, living world |
| **Subtle breathing** | Organic life, waiting, anticipation |

## PART 4: STREAM-SPECIFIC APPLICATION

### Analyzing Narrative Beats

For each stream section, map:
```
SECTION: [name]
├── Narrative beat: [what happens]
├── Emotional state: [what viewer should feel]
├── Visual metaphor: [abstract representation]
├── Style reference: [from library above]
├── Key colors: [2-3 hex codes]
├── Composition: [framework choice]
├── Motion: [camera/element movement]
└── Transition to next: [visual bridge]
```

### Creating Visual Continuity

**Thread elements through the stream:**
- **Recurring motif:** A shape, object, or pattern that evolves
- **Color arc:** Palette shifts that mirror emotional journey
- **Spatial progression:** From confined → expansive (or reverse)
- **Light evolution:** Dawn → dusk, or darkness → light

### Avoiding Common AI Pitfalls

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Everything glows" | Specify matte surfaces, absorbed light |
| "Plastic skin" | Request film grain, subsurface scattering |
| "Oversaturated" | Specify muted, desaturated, limited palette |
| "Generic epic" | Choose specific, unusual reference |
| "No focal point" | Define clear subject hierarchy |
| "Weightless objects" | Request gravity, grounding shadows |
